# Ashes-of-the-sun
You are The Last Ember, a dying ancestral flame born from a forgotten sun-myth. Fire is your life, your weapon, your soul. To exist, you must burn others, yet every spark you unleash steals from your own fading light. Every choice is sacrifice. How long will you burn before the dark claims you?
